This is a development version of 3dmigoto GIMI. Original program from https://github.com/bo3b/3Dmigoto.

I have modified the 3dmigoto .dll and .ini for compatability with genshin, and turned on most of the features of the 3dmigoto plugin. 

I update the features of this program from time to time, so check back at https://github.com/SilentNightSound/GI-Model-Importer to see if there are any updates.

Place any mods created in the Mods folder and press F10 in game in order to load them.

If you have any questions or issues, please open an issue on the github page or send me a DM on discord (SilentNightSound#7430)

这是原神的3dmigoto加载器，在使用过程中发现以闪亮之名也可以使用，但是只能做些简单的修改，导出的vb.txt和ib.txt使用现有的blender插件无法正确导入。
因此只能做一些服装的隐藏，希望有大佬能够开发出能够修改模型的脚本。
